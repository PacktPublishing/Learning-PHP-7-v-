## About the Video Course
PHP is back and is faster and more lightweight than ever. The world of web technology is seamlessly evolving, and PHP 7’s simplicity and prowess addresses the requirements of current and future web and mobile application development.

Learning PHP 7 demonstrates how to script for the web, providing everything from simple PHP commands to advanced data manipulations.

The course takes a deep dive into basic PHP concepts such as variables, constants, operators, arrays, conditionals, and loops, which every developer needs to master. The course also covers object-oriented paradigms and coding standards, which acts as the do’s and don'ts of writing code.

The core of the course lies in bringing all the newly introduced features to fruition. This is done through the creation of a fun social web application where a viewer can post and share pictures including features of likes and comments. The use of several controllers in the application provides the viewer with a learning curve to add more interactivity to their own applications. The course also shows you how to build an administrative panel with an intuitive menu and create a dynamic page to manage the users, photos, and comments in the application.

Important topics such as creating an API for an RSS feed, deploying with Docker and Amazon AWS, and versioning with Git are a real bonus for blooming web developers.
